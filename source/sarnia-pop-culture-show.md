    <li>b. The game I'm working on right now, <em>Revenants</em>, is a non-linear exploratory action sidescroller, with an emphasis on world-building mechanics and clever use of locational abilities, rather than your typical permanent equipment and unrestrained upgrades.</li>

<h2>Sarnia Pop Culture Show 2013</h2>
<p>The <a href='https://www.facebook.com/SarniaPopCultureShow'>Sarnia Pop Culture Show</a> was pretty fun. It was this little local comic-book/gaming/nerd culture event in my hometown, which they held at the Holiday Inn.</p>
<p>I got a table there! Had a little exhibit of some of my work. Maybe someone out there found it interesting! Here is a picture of me wearing my exhibitor badge:</p>

<p>My table consisted of some business cards in the middle, a Super Game Boy to the left, and a playable 2-player multiplayer game called <em>Yak Maniac</em>, to the right. I wired PS3 controllers up to my netbook to make this nicer, using joy2key + DS3 Tool.</p>

<p>My self-promoting Game Boy demo, running off a Super Game Boy:</p>

<p>It looks a lot cooler in action, so I recorded a video of it in an emulator, pictured below. Also, the source is <a href='https://github.com/Bananattack/wiz/tree/master/examples/gameboy/selfpromo'>on GitHub</a>, for fun. It's pretty hacktastic and contains lots of unnecessary, unused stuff copy-pasted from my Snake ROM.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>So going back to the game that was on display, <em>Yak Maniac</em>. It's pretty weird. A few people said this game was pretty fun, and that I should put it up on my website or something. Here's a video of the game, in the newly-added single player mode:</p>

<p>Yak Maniac is a ridiculous about angry yaks that eat buildings and balloons to collect fruit, while avoiding poisonous syringes, bombs and fast-moving trucks. One or two people can play!</p>

<p>My business cards were pretty rad, also. Pretty minimal, just my name and my website, since I figure that's all I really needed there.</p>

<p>Anyway, all in all, the Sarnia Pop Culture show was a pretty good time. There weren't exactly many things there in the way of video game stuff (and I was the only game developer there, but that does not suprise me), mostly comic stuff and some tabletop games, but I figured it was still fun to be a part of something. And maybe the line-up will change somewhat in the future.</p>
<p>I had hoped to have a short playable demo of <em>Revenants</em> on display, but admittedly progress has been slower than I anticipated, and I ran out of time. Oh well.</p>
<p>At any rate, it was still enjoyable, and I think I might have to go again next time!</p>
