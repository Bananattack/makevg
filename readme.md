mdtool.py
---------
This script is useful for taking a bunch of markdown files and dumping the HTML output. To use this, make sure that Python-Markdown's `markdown` module (from https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown/ or in PyPI) is installed or otherwise on your `sys.path` or `PYTHONPATH`.

Run `./mdtool.py` without arguments to see its usage.
