**make.vg** (<http://make.vg/>) is a webspace for Andrew G. Crowell, an independent game developer. This repository serves as an open location for the pages that will appear on the site. All documents are HTML fragments, cleverly tagged as Markdown files, so that they can be previewed on Github. After all, HTML is permissible subset of Markdown! They also contain some metadata, which whatever, is kinda minor.
